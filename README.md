# Metis-Project-4

In this project, I scraped 120 thousand tweets off twitter with the hashtag genshinimpact. I used NMF and LDA to topic model the top 10 topics during each scraping. Since the theme of this project was primarily EDA, I did not create a reccomender system for my data. This data can establish a trends in Twitter about topics, and we will be able to see how the opinion of the game persists with users on Twitter. Source: Twitter. Tools used: Matplotlib, SKLearn, Tweetpy, SNScrape, Pandas, spacy, pyLDAvis, nltk, NMF
